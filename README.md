## 🎯 **What You're Aiming For**  
You’ve decided to join a popular gym chain, excited to begin your fitness journey. Upon arrival, you find the owner embroiled in a heated argument with a member over session registration.  

After a long wait, the owner apologizes and explains the chaos is due to their outdated card-based system. Surprised, you offer a solution to modernize their management process. Impressed with your expertise, the owner promises you **3 months of free membership** if you help! 💪

The owner provides you with the following details:  

- **Gymnasiums**:  
  - Each gym has a unique name, address, and phone number.  

- **Members**:  
  - Each member belongs to one gymnasium and must provide:  
    - A unique identifier  
    - Last name, first name  
    - Address

- **Sessions**:  
  - Each session has:

## 🖥️ **Your Mission**

1. **Gymnasiums**  
2. **Members**  
3. **Sessions**  
4. **Coaches**

## 🚀 **Deliverables**  
- A professional ERM diagram showcasing the relationships and attributes of the entities.  
- Ensure proper cardinality (e.g., one gym has many members, one session has up to 20 members, etc.).
