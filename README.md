## 🎯 **What You're Aiming For**  
You’ve decided to join a popular gym chain, excited to begin your fitness journey. Upon arrival, you find the owner embroiled in a heated argument with a member over session registration.  

After a long wait, the owner apologizes and explains the chaos is due to their outdated card-based system. Surprised, you offer a solution to modernize their management process. Impressed with your expertise, the owner promises you **3 months of free membership** if you help! 💪  

## 📋 **Business Requirements**  

The owner provides you with the following details:  

- **Gymnasiums**:  
  - Each gym has a unique name, address, and phone number.  

- **Members**:  
  - Each member belongs to one gymnasium and must provide:  
    - A unique identifier  
    - Last name, first name  
    - Address  
    - Date of birth  
    - Gender  

- **Sessions**:  
  - Each session has:  
    - A sport type (e.g., yoga, weightlifting, boxing)  
    - A schedule  
    - A maximum of 20 members  

- **Coaches**:  
  - Sessions are led by up to 2 coaches.  
  - Each coach has:  
    - Last name, first name

    - Specialty (e.g., Pilates, CrossFit)

## 🖥️ **Your Mission**  

Based on the requirements above, create an **Entity-Relationship Model (ERM)** for the gym's management system. The model should visually represent the relationships between:  

1. **Gymnasiums**  
2. **Members**  
3. **Sessions**  
4. **Coaches**  

---

## 🚀 **Deliverables**  
- A professional ERM diagram showcasing the relationships and attributes of the entities.  
- Ensure proper cardinality (e.g., one gym has many members, one session has up to 20 members, etc.).
